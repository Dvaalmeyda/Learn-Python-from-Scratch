Tom wants to sell his car but he doesn't know how much he should sell his car for
Tom wants to sell his car for as much as he can.
But he also wants to set the price reasonably so someone would want to purchase it.
So the price he sets should represent the value of the car.

Q : How can we help Tom determine the best price for his car?

To answer these questions, we're going to need some data.

1. Understanding the data
2. Python packages for data science :
    <br> a. Scientifics Computing
        1. Pandas   : Data structures & tools for effective data manipulation, primary = 2 dimensional table for easy indexing, fast access to structured data
        2. Numpy    : Arrays & Matrices, for fast array processing
        3. Scipy    : Includes function for some advance math problems
    b. Data Visualization
        1. Matplotlib   : Plot & Graph
        2. Seaborn      : Plot: heat maps, time series, violin plots
    c. Algorithmic
        1. Scikit-Learn : Machine Learning (Regression, classification, etc)
        2. Statsmodels  : Explore data, estimate statistical models, and statistical tests
